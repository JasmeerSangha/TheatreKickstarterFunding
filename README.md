The analysis done on the outcome of kickstarted plays shows that campaigns with a goal less than $5000 havea high chance of success. Though the line graph suggests that some higher goals may also produce a significant amount of successful campaigns, the number of campaigns in these ranges is small compared to the lower end (75% of all plays have funding goals less than $10,000). The plot shows the percentage of successful campaigns but comparing the amount (instead of percentage) of successful campaigns would better illustrate this. A simple line or stacked bar graph could be used, though these also prove troublesome as the number of enrtries in each range vary so wildly (a log graph might help).

When analysing theater kickstarters throughout the year, it is clear that the summer months are most active. Those seeking crowdfunding are less likely to do so in the winter months, I would suggest this is due to people having less disposable income heading into the christmas season. As kickstarter is a platform for individuals to invest or donate money into projects that either return no goods/services or yield returns potentially years into the future, spending that money when a major holiday is imminent has a noticeable impact. The fact that the number of failed projects stays relatively constant and the ratio of successes versus failures decreases over the winter supports this claim.
